As a Fellow of the **Five College Center for Crossroads in the Study of the Americas Seminar** Ben Gebre-Medhin had the opportunity to present a preliminary research proposal for the Disciplinary Address Project to a broad scholarly audience. The presentation was motivated by opportunities to use our novel dataset drawn from a relatively standardized event in the life of the social science disciplines -- the address delivered by the president of the disciplinary association to the attendees of the annual conference -- to revisit questions about the history of ideas.

The presentation also provided an overview of the ongoing collaborative data acquisition and cleaning process which is distributed, as well as plans for future analysis.
